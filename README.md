# Grandstand Gauntlet

GameJam [Brackeys 2023](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-9), for a week.
The Theme is ![An end is a new beginning](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzExMzAyNDc0LnBuZw==/original/maBIE1.png)

## Game Ideas

Fighters in arenas or galleries.
Death makes us take control of a surrounding normie entity,
like a spectator

### Concept

- Fight only in populated areas.
- Build arenas to defeat the enemy.
- Create a cult, the members follow us to act as a receptacle.
- Don't overuse the reappearance or the Boss will start a killing spree in the crowd.
- At the end of the fight, we can take possession of the enemy and resume the symmetrical fight
or leave to face other stronger enemy, in the next arena.
One can decide to cut the cycle by refusing the transfer, and say:
"Everything has an end".
